# Hi, I'm Steve Purcell

I'm an extremely effective "full-stack" and "polyglot" software
engineer and leader, focusing particularly on modern web
technologies. With 20 years of hands-on industry experience I
understand how to select, build and refine software to add business
value, and to reduce costs.

You can hire me to lead your software team, solve hard programming
problems, advise you on technology choices, or coach your developers
using the latest industry practices and tools.

I've worked as a senior consultant at elite companies such as
ThoughtWorks, and consulted independently with industry-leading
businesses both in the UK and overseas, but web start-ups are my real
passion: I've started some, led development at several others, and
consulted with yet more.

Areas of particular technical expertise and interest currently include
front and back-end web development, [Ruby on Rails](/rails-consulting), Clojure,
Javascript, Linux, PostgreSQL and Haskell, but I have a high level of
knowledge across a very wide range of languages and open source
technologies. With my fingers in many pies, I'm often among the 100 most
active worldwide contributors on [Github](https://github.com/purcell).

or feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:steve@sanityinc.com).
