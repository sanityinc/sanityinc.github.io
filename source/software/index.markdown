In the course of my work, I have contributed to many open source
projects.

Back in the days, my minor claim to fame was that I wrote
[PyUnit](http://pyunit.sf.net/) , which is part of the Python standard
library as "unittest.py".

These days I have my fingers in dozens of projects: check out my
[github profile](https://github.com/purcell/).
