My focus is on building my own businesses, but I also enjoy helping
consulting clients maximise their efficiency and build amazing web
software.

Whether you're planning a new project, facing technical difficulties,
need an extra hand or just want some advice, I can help you.

I've been using Ruby on Rails since early 2005, and was the technical
lead on one of Europe's largest Rails projects beginning in 2006.  In
addition to helping many Rails clients since, I single-handedly
built [LookToTheStars.org](https://www.looktothestars.org/), which
efficiently serves millions of visitors thanks to careful design and
end-to-end optimisation.

I have had several patches accepted into the Rails core, and my
Ruby/Rails knowledge is just part of my 20 years hands-on industry
experience at various internet start-ups and top companies such as TIBCO
and ThoughtWorks, in technical positions extending to CTO level.
