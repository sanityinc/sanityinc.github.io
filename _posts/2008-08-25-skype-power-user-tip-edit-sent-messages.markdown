Ever quickly sent a skype message, only to immediately notice a typo?
You can fix it using the following trick.

<!-- more -->

Imagine you just sent "The radio is borken".

To fix "borken", you simply enter this follow-message: "s/borken/broken/".

The sent message will be updated, and marked as "edited". Magic, eh?

This was tested between two Macs running Skype 2.7, so it may or may
not work for you too. It's only possible to alter the last sent
message you sent, and not earlier messages or those sent by another
member of the chat.

UNIX users will note that the syntax echoes that of sed, awk, perl, vi
and other tools, and the "s/old/new/" idiom is commonly used in
geek-to-geek chats.

*(Credit to my colleague and fellow [Ruby on Rails consultant Stefan Kaes](https://railsexpress.de/) for noticing this.)*
