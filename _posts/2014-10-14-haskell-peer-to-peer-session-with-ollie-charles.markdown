I recently sat down with local Haskell hero Ollie Charles to record a
video of him solving a fun programming problem.

Drew Neil's
[Peer To Peer](https://peertopeer.io/h/sp1/)
video series captures the working practices of experts in various
programming languages, providing viewers with tips, tricks and
insights.

Each video features a host, who brings along a task and acts as a
"customer", and a guest, who has to solve the challenge in real time
using their tools of choice.

For this video, in which I was the host, I proposed that Ollie tackle
Dave Thomas'
[Word Chains Kata](https://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/) -- I
use this non-trivial problem myself whenever I learn a new programming
language, so I knew that it would keep Ollie on his toes.

Ollie's [own site](https://ocharles.org.uk/) is a treasure-trove of
carefully-explained Haskell tips and tricks, so I wasn't surprised to
find myself enjoying his problem-solving approach and learning a lot.

To see what happened, check out the video:

After the session, and having picked up a couple of new tricks from
Ollie, I even felt inspired to tackle the problem in Haskell
[once more](https://github.com/purcell/wordchainsrevenge) myself.

*Update: there's also a great [follow-up video](https://peertopeer.io/c/jw1)
featuring Ollie hosting John Wiegley*
